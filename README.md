#### ***Purpose***
As an international student who studies abroad in the U.S. as well as in the Europe this summer 2019, I sometimes struggle to make friends. Finding someone that shares the same passion, motivation and personalities with me was quite challenging as I am an introvert person and I have a hard time reaching out to others.
I decided to pitch the idea of buddyUp during the bootcamp as I think it would create a platform for introvert people like me to meet new people in a one-on-one basis, which is easier to get to know the other than large-scale meetup events.

#### ***Bugs/features to be fixed***
- App was designed to work on mobile phone browser, so user interface for laptop browser does not look nice.
- App was seeded with data of users from Barcelona for the purpose of demo, and since it is not for use, if user attempts to try out for another area, it does not show any result when search.
- Chat functionality is not ideal as messages are not encrypted.
- Re-organize stylesheets.
